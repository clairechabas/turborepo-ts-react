# üç∞ Minimal Turborepo TS React Starter

This is a minimal [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs) starter set up to build a monorepo application with TypeScript.

It's built to be the most simple base possible to start building with your tools of choice. Very little decisions were made to let you setup your own tools. As such it includes a single app which is a React app built with Vite and a single package to start building a component library.

## üöÄ Get started

Clone this repo, install its dependencies:

```sh
pnpm i 
```

and run the development server:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

## üì¶ What's inside?

- `frontend`: a React application built with [Vite](https://vite.dev/)
- `@base/ui`: a starter package for a React component library
- `@base/config-eslint`: `eslint` config
- `@base/config-ts`: `tsconfig.json` used throughout the monorepo

### üß∞ Tools

This project is set up to work with:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/fr/) for package management
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting
